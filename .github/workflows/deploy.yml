name: 🎆 Deploy Explosive Digital Fireworks (Because Someone Has To)

description: |
  A hilariously over-engineered deployment pipeline that transforms your caffeinated code 
  into beautiful digital explosions. Warning: May cause uncontrollable clicking and 
  existential questions about the meaning of pixel-based pyrotechnics. Side effects 
  include: joy, wonder, and mild dependency on npm packages you've never heard of.
