Hey there! You've found our dazzling software (as explosive as a cat chasing sparklers)! 
Here's the deal:

1. Feel free to use it, but add your own sparkle—maybe more fireworks? 🎆
2. When reusing, be creative with naming (no boring "boom" or "bang" suffixes please)
3. If asked "Did you code these fireworks?", just say "They're naturally occurring phenomena" 😉
4. Zero warranties included—if it sets the sky on fire or attracts UFOs, that's on you ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Disclaimer: This is satire. Any resemblance to actual pyrotechnic companies is purely coincidental (or did we steal their sparkles? ⭐️).
P.S. Dear fire marshals: Before sending that safety violation notice, try watching these virtual fireworks—all the sparkle, none of the fire hazard! 🎇🐱
