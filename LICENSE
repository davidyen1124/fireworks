🎆 CONGRATULATIONS! 🎆

You've discovered this magnificent piece of digital pyrotechnics!

   - But seriously, who's going to pay for digital fireworks?
   - If someone does, please share the contact info

2. **Attribution Required**: If you use this, please mention us

4. **Liability Waiver**: If this software causes:
   - Your computer to crash
   - Your productivity to plummet
   - An uncontrollable urge to click things
   - Existential dread about the meaninglessness of digital explosions
   - Actual explosions (how?!)
   - Time travel paradoxes
   - Your cat to judge you
   - A sudden career change to pyrotechnics
   
   That's entirely on you, buddy. 🤷‍♂️

5. **Modification Rights**: Feel free to improve our code
   - Though "improvement" is subjective

🎪 SPECIAL THANKS:

- To everyone who clicks things on the internet
- To the inventors of the Canvas API (the real heroes)
- To whoever decided JavaScript was a good idea
- To coffee, the real MVP
- To everyone who pretends to understand particle physics
- To Michael Bay, for inspiring our explosion aesthetic

💡 FINAL NOTES:

If you've read this entire license, you either:
a) Are incredibly thorough (respect)
b) Are procrastinating on actual work (we get it)

d) Are a bot (hello, future AI overlords)

Remember: Life's too short for boring software licenses.
Now go forth and create beautiful, meaningless digital explosions! 🎇
