_Finally, a way to blow stuff up without the FBI showing up at your door!_

üéÆ [Live Demo](https://davidyen1124.github.io/fireworks/) _(Warning: May cause uncontrollable clicking)_

![Fireworks Together Preview](media/preview.gif)

_Look at those beautiful pixels exploding in perfect harmony! Just like my code review feedback._

## üéÜ Features (AKA: What You're Getting Into)

- **Real-time fireworks animation**: Because static images are for quitters
- **Interactive click/touch controls**: Your mouse has never felt so powerful
- **Twinkling star background**: Stars that twinkle more than your career prospects
- **Smooth rocket trails**: Smoother than your pickup lines
- **Responsive design**: Works on devices from potato phones to NASA supercomputers
- **Beautiful color variations**: More colors than a unicorn's breakfast

## üöÄ Getting Started (If You Dare)

_"Another JavaScript project? How original!" - Every developer ever_

1. Clone this masterpiece (and by masterpiece, I mean organized chaos):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidyen1124/fireworks.git
cd fireworks
```

2. Install dependencies (prepare for npm install hell):

```bash
npm install
# Go grab a coffee, write a novel, learn a new language...
```

3. Start the development server (cross your fingers):

```bash
npm run dev
# If it doesn't work, try turning it off and on again
```

## üí´ How to Use (It's Not Rocket Science... Wait, Actually It Is)

- **Click or touch anywhere**: Watch the magic happen (or watch it crash spectacularly)
- **Hold down**: Create continuous fireworks (because one explosion is never enough)
- **Move while holding**: Create trails (like breadcrumbs, but more explosive)

_Pro tip: If nothing happens, you probably broke it. Congratulations!_

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With (The Usual Suspects)

- **React**: Because vanilla JS is apparently too mainstream
- **HTML Canvas**: The last bastion of drawing on the web
- **JavaScript**: The language that keeps on giving (bugs)
- **Vite**: Because Webpack wasn't complicated enough

## üì¶ Deployment (The "It Works on My Machine" Experience)

This project magically deploys itself to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. It's like having a personal assistant, except it never complains and works for free.

üåê **Live at**: https://davidyen1124.github.io/fireworks/

_If the site is down, it's not my fault. Blame the internet, climate change, or your ISP._

## üé® Preview (Spoiler Alert: It's Shiny)

Experience the earth-shattering revelation of clicking on a screen and watching colorful particles move around! Revolutionary stuff, really. Perfect for:

- Procrastinating on actual work
- Impressing your cat
- Demonstrating to your parents that you "do computers"
- Filling the void in your soul with artificial explosions

---

_Disclaimer: No actual fireworks were harmed in the making of this project. Your productivity, however, is another story._
